# Basics of Humanoid Robotics

## Anatomy and Design Principles

Humanoid robots are designed to resemble and mimic human behavior. They typically feature a head, torso, two arms, and two legs, though some variations exist. The design aims to enable human-like interaction and navigation in human environments.

## Actuators and Sensors

Humanoid robots use various types of actuators to move their joints:
- Servo motors for precise control
- Pneumatic actuators for human-like compliance
- Series elastic actuators for safe human interaction

Sensors include:
- IMUs for balance and orientation
- Force/torque sensors for interaction
- Vision systems for perception
- Tactile sensors for touch feedback

## Locomotion and Balance

Maintaining balance is one of the greatest challenges in humanoid robotics. Techniques include:
- Zero Moment Point (ZMP) control
- Capture Point methods
- Whole-body control approaches

## Control Systems

Humanoid robots require sophisticated control systems that coordinate multiple degrees of freedom while maintaining stability and achieving tasks.
