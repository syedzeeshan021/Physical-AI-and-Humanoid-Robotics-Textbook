# Capstone: Simple AI-Robot Pipeline

## Integration of All Concepts

This capstone chapter brings together all the concepts learned throughout the textbook to create a complete AI-robot pipeline.

## Project Overview

We'll implement a simple system that:
1. Takes a natural language command
2. Processes it using AI
3. Plans appropriate robot actions
4. Executes those actions in simulation
5. Provides feedback to the user

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Natural Language Processing
- Parse user commands
- Extract intent and parameters
- Validate command feasibility

### Step 2: Action Planning
- Generate robot action sequence
- Check for safety constraints
- Optimize execution path

### Step 3: Execution and Monitoring
- Execute planned actions
- Monitor execution status
- Handle exceptions and errors

### Step 4: Feedback and Learning
- Provide execution feedback
- Learn from execution results
- Improve future performance

## Assessment and Evaluation

The system will be evaluated based on:
- Command interpretation accuracy
- Action execution success rate
- Response time
- User satisfaction
