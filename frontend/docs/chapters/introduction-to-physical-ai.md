# Introduction to Physical AI

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI is an emerging field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems and robotics. It represents the intersection of machine learning, robotics, and embodied intelligence, where AI agents learn and interact with the physical world.

## Historical Context

The concept of Physical AI has evolved from early work in robotics and machine learning. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI must deal with the complexities of the real world including uncertainty, dynamics, and physical constraints.

## Key Principles

1. Embodied Cognition: Intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent and its environment
2. Real-world Learning: Agents learn through physical interaction rather than just data
3. Multi-modal Perception: Combining visual, auditory, tactile and other sensory inputs
4. Adaptive Behavior: Systems that can adapt to changing physical conditions

## Applications and Impact

Physical AI has applications in robotics, autonomous vehicles, smart manufacturing, and human-computer interaction. It promises to revolutionize how we interact with technology in physical spaces.
