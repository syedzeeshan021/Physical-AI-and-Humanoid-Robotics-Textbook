# Vision-Language-Action Systems

## Computer Vision Integration

Modern robotics increasingly relies on computer vision for perception. Vision-language-action systems combine visual understanding with language processing to enable complex robot behaviors.

## Language Understanding

Language understanding in robotics involves:
- Natural language processing
- Command interpretation
- Context awareness
- Dialogue management

## Action Planning

Action planning bridges perception and language with physical action:
- Task planning
- Motion planning
- Execution monitoring
- Error recovery

## Multimodal AI

Multimodal AI systems process multiple types of input simultaneously:
- Visual information
- Language input
- Tactile feedback
- Audio cues

These systems enable robots to understand and respond to complex, real-world scenarios that require integration of multiple sensory modalities.
